## Project Brief

### Vision
Build a hardened, OAuth-first Moltbot/Clawdbot variant with a unified Auth Broker layer.

### Goals
- Provide a single interface to authenticate and switch between model providers.
- Prefer OAuth-based logins over API keys where available.
- Keep the system modular and secure by default.

### Non-Goals
- Pursue GLM 4.7 OAuth (not available; API-key only).

### Stakeholders
- TBD
